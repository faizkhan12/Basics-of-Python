#9-3. Users: Make a class called User. Create two attributes called first_name
#  and last_name, and then create several other attributes that are typically stored
#  in a user profile. Make a method called describe_user() that prints a summary
#  of the userâ€™s information. Make another method called greet_user() that prints
#  a personalized greeting to the user.
#  Create several instances representing different users, and call both methods
#  for each user.

#           Author name: Faiz Khan
